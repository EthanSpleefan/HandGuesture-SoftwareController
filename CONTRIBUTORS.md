# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for expressing interest. We expect you to follow these guidelines to ensure smooth contributions.

* If you're making code changes, please describe your changes clearly and concisely. Ensure that the workflow is able to run successfully without any issues.
* If you're changing workflow files, you must clearly describe your changes, any new or updated workflows used, and what actions require secrets to be set (if at all). If secrets are needed you will need to state how to obtain the secret.
* Documentation changes simply just need to ensure capitalisation, spelling, etc... is all well and good.
* Make sure commit titles are concise. If you need more words, the commit description is there as well.
